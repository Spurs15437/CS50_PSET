--| 162 | Eugene  | 2021 | 7     | 28  |
--I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I recognized.

--| 163 | Raymond | 2021 | 7     | 28  |
--As the thief was leaving the bakery, they called someone who talked to them for less than a minute.
--In the call, I heard the thief say that they were planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow.
--The thief then asked the person on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket. |
